# Introduction
Musical fountains are becoming increasingly popular worldwide due to their ability to seamlessly combine visual and auditory elements. However, designing and setting up a musical fountain requires technical and creative expertise in various fields such as engineering, computer science, and music.

In the scope of the course (HAI606I: Programming Project 2), we have chosen to develop an interactive musical fountain capable of synchronizing water jets with music. This fountain will be controlled by a Raspberry Pi, along with several hardware and software components. We will utilize the following materials for this project:

# Hardware Components:
- Raspberry Pi
- 12V DC Fountain
- L298N Module
- MCP23017 Module
# Software Components:
- RPI.GPIO
- Sketchup
- Librosa
- Matplotlib
- Raspberry Pi OS
- Turtle.

This readme file provides an overview of the different stages involved in the design and implementation of our musical fountain project. It also highlights the solutions we have found to overcome challenges encountered along the way, as well as the ideas we had to abandon due to various reasons.
